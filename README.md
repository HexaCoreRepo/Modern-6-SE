## About

With Modern 6 SE, you no longer need to jailbreak your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch to get Modern 6's incredibly sharp iOS 6 icons! Modern 6 SE includes over 110 iOS 6 app icons taken directly from Modern 6.

Each individual app icon is incredibly sharp and they are all intentionally built to look amazing on all of the current iPhone displays. Each icon is compared directly to an iPhone 5 running iOS 6 to ensure the best look possible and that each icon is nearly identical to its original icon.^

Just like Modern 6 for jailbroken devices, Modern 6 SE provides unmatched support. Modern 6 SE is updated consistently ensuring the best possible experience, while regularly gaining new app icons. You can even request icons to be added - as long as they've had an official iOS 6 or earlier app icon.
